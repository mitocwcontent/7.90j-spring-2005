description: This problem set reviews a simple maximum likelihood method to estimate
  per-chip scaling factors for normalization of expression array data, using spiked-in
  controls with known quantities. There is only one problem, but we expect an answer
  for each sentence or clause that begins with the words, "Write down..." Please include
  the full derivations of all work formulae written, not just the final answer.
